			  target="_blank">Statewide Water Supply Initiative (SWSI)</a>, first completed in 2004, was a comprehensive analysis of existing water supplies and existing and projected 
			  water demands through the year 2030.  One of the major findings from SWSI was that there will be a gap in water supply by 2030 for Colorado as a whole and for nearly all 
			  of the 8 major basins (figure at right). </p>  
			  <p>To address the gap, water management structural and non-structural options were identified for each basin. "Identified Projects and Processes" (IPPs) were 
			  considered to be relatively well-defined options that could reasonably be expected to be implemented by 2030 to address current or increasing water needs.  A second 
			  category of options was titled "Options for Alternatives".  These were options for meeting the remaining gap and were considered to have implementation issues, were more 
			  conceptual in nature or were more likely to be implemented in later years.  Many of the options identified that would benefit agricultural, environmental or recreational 
			  users were categorized as Options for Alternatives because their implementation was less certain due to reasons such as a lack of suitable funding.  As such, the initial 
			  IPP list for each basin tended to focus on municipal and industrial (M&I) uses. </p>
              <p>It was determined that IPPs had the ability to meet about 80% of Colorado's municipal and industrial water needs through 2030.  However, if the IPPs are 
			  not successfully implemented, Colorado would see a greater reduction in irrigated agricultural lands as municipal and industrial water providers seek permanent transfers
			  of agricultural water rights.</p>
              <p>General categories of SWSI 2004 M&I IPPs included:</p>  
			  <ul>
				<li>conservation</li> 
				<li>growing into existing supply (new infrastructure needed to use existing supplies)</li> 
				<li>increased reuse of existing or future consumable supplies</li> 
				<li>rehabilitation, reoperation or enlargement of existing water supply facilities</li>
				<li>water transfers</li>
				<li>new water supply projects (later called new transbasin diversions)</li>
				<li>augmentation plans</li>
				<li>acquiring agricultural rights through development of irrigated lands or annexation requirements</li>

              <h2>IPP Background: SWSI 2010</h2>
              <p><a href="http://cwcb.state.co.us/water-management/water-supply-planning/Pages/SWSI2010.aspx" target="_blank">SWSI 2010</a> updated the SWSI 2004 study.  
			  Key elements of the update were:</p>  
			  <ul>
			    <li>an analysis of water supply demands to 2050 (SWSI 2004 was to 2030)</li>
				<li>a summary of environmental and recreational needs in each basin, as identified by basin roundtables</li>
				<li>an analysis of supply availability in the Colorado River</li>
				<li>implementation elements associated with identified projects, water conservation, agricultural transfers and development of new water supplies</li>
				<li>the development of estimated costs of implementing water supply strategies</li>
			  </ul>	
              <p>More-detailed IPP information was gathered during SWSI 2010 than was developed for SWSI 2004.  The following categories were used to describe M&I IPPs:</p>
			  <ul>
			    <li>agricultural water transfers</li>
				<li>reuse of existing fully consumable supplies</li>
				<li>growth into existing supplies (new infrastructure needed to use existing supplies)</li> 
				<li>regional in-basin projects</li>
				<li>new transbasin projects</li>
				<li>firming in-basin water rights (typically with new storage)</li>
				<li>firming transbasin water rights (typically with new storage)</li>  
			  </ul>	
			  <p>If successfully implemented, these IPPs were to meet some, but not all, of Colorado's 2050 M&I water needs (figure at right).  Therefore, these 
			  projects were considered critical to meeting Colorado's future water supply needs.</p>
			  <p>A different approach was taken for environmental and recreational (E&R, also called nonconsumptive) IPPs.  Each basin roundtable described focus areas that 
			  represented where Colorado's important E&R attributes are located, such as species.  The focus area maps were intended to assist in identifying where E&R needs are being 
			  met, where additional future study may need to take place or where implementation projects are needed.  The Colorado Water Conservation Board (CWCB) was then able to 
			  preliminarily identify focus areas with and without IPPs.</p>
			  <p>The key finding of SWSI 2010 was that Colorado faces a shortage of water for meeting <b><i>both</i></b> consumptive and E&R needs.  The key recommendation 
			  was that basin roundtables should determine and pursue projects and methods that address multiple purposes, including municipal, industrial, agricultural, 
			  environmental, recreational, risk management and compact compliance needs.  This recommendation led to the creation of Basin Implementation Plans (BIPs) for each 
			  basin.</p>

              <p class="lead" style="color:white; font-size:18px;">The South Platte and Metro basins elected to create a single Basin Implementation Plan (BIP) focusing on how to implement SWSI recommendations 
			  to meet the water supply gap.  The <a href="https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/SouthPlatteBasinImplementationPlan-04172015.pdf" target="_blank" style="color:orange;"> 
			  BIP</a> was completed in 2015 and continued to use the same general categories to describe municipal and industrial IPPs as SWSI 2010, such as agricultural water 
			  transfers, growth into existing supplies and firming in-basin water rights.  Much of the IPP data was not greatly updated from the SWSI 2010 list.</p>
			  <p class="lead" style="color:white; font-size:18px;">The list of IPPs ranges from general projects, such as "Morgan County Unspecified IPP Firming In-Basin", to specific projects, such as 
			  <a href="https://www.auroragov.org/residents/water/water_system/water_sources/prairie_waters/" target="_blank" style="color:orange;">Prairie Waters</a> (The City of Aurora's water 
			  reuse project). The IPP dataset contains fields for yield, cost, sponsor(s) and source of water for the project, but these data are not available for all projects, 
			  particularly water source.</p>

             <h2>South Platte & Metro BIP and Agricultural IPPs</h2>
			  <p>As indicated in the figure to the left, irrigated acreage in the South Platte Basin is projected to decline by 
			  2050 due to reallocation of agricultural water supplies to municipal and industrial uses.  However, IPPs specific to agricultural needs were not developed 
			  in the 2015 BIP. It is generally understood that reductions in yield from M&I IPPs will likely lead to much greater increases in agricultural transfers as 
			  a means to meet M&I demands.  Therefore, to meet agricultural needs, M&I IPP implementation must be successful.  While specific projects were not detailed 
			  for agricultural needs, multipurpose projects that also benefit agriculture will most likely involve new Colorado River supplies (BIP, p.4-36).  Additional 
			  surface storage projects that benefit agriculture, such as the <a href="https://chatfieldreallocation.org/" target="_blank">Chatfield Storage Reallocation Project</a>, 
			  would allow agricultural users to capture wet year flows and store them as drought reserve.</p>
			  <p>It is recommended that IPPs should be categorized to clearly indicate agricultural benefit.</p>

            <h2>South Platte & Metro BIP and Environmental & Recreational IPPs</h2>
			<p>Appendix D of the 2015 BIP (Environmental and Recreational Assessment Methodology and Framework) provides a list of E&R IPPs that are based on 
			  SWSI 2010.  General categories of projects include:</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>mine remediation</li> 
			  <li>land conservation</li> 
			  <li>river restoration</li> 
			  <li>fish passage structures</li>
			  <li>riparian restoration</li>
			  <li>bank stabilization</li>
			  <li>channel reconstruction</li>
			  <li>minimum instream flows</li>
			  <li>fish reintroductions</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The SWSI 2010 E&R IPP list is not publicly available in machine-readable format.  Therefore, E&R IPPs were not able to be mapped.  However, 
			instream flow rights can be considered a form of IPP because they fulfill an environmental need.  Instream flow rights are rights for minimum flows made exclusively 
			by the Colorado Water Conservation Board (CWCB) to preserve or improve the natural environment to a reasonable degree. This map shows decreed instream flow rights 
			in the South Platte and Metro basins.</p>

              <p>The <a href="http://cwcb.state.co.us/water-management/water-supply-planning/Pages/SWSIUpdate.aspx" target="_blank">SWSI Update</a> project is 
			  currently updating the SWSI 2010 study using new data and methodologies, with expected completion in 2019.  The Open Water Foundation also received a CWCB grant 
			  for the South Platte Data Platform, which is implementing data analyses and visualizations to help the South Platte and Metro Roundtables better use data 
			  resources and tell stories relevant to the South Platte Basin.  As part of these projects, IPP data from SWSI 2010 were reviewed and recommendations were made 
			  regarding the standardization of data formats and the addition of new content.  The following recommendations were made:</p>
			  <ul>
			    <li>datasets should exist in a flat, Excel file format.  Excel is a common tool and the datasets can be maintained with minimal skill and can be used by 
				multiple software tools.</li>
				<li>a unique identifier should be given for each IPP, in the format of Basin-Year-Number, such as SP-2015-0001.  This allows for cross-referencing between 
				datasets.</li>
				<li>list the proponents of the project (the entities that brought forth the project, such as a municipality) and provide the name of a person that can serve as a contact.</li>
				<li>describe the type of need the project fulfills, such as municipal and industrial, agricultural or environmental and recreational.</li>
				<li>indicate the water body that is the primary source of water for the project, using the <a href="https://geonames.usgs.gov/apex/f?p=138:1:0:::::" 
				target="_blank">Geographic Names Information System</a> ID and name.  This allows for cross-referencing between datasets, such as the 
                <a href="http://cdss.state.co.us/GIS/Pages/AllGISData.aspx" target="_blank">Source Water Route Framework</a>.</li>
				<li>provide a narrative description of where the water ends up, such as a municipality, ditch or if the water stays in the river (as with an environmental 
				IPP).</li>
				<li>provide the IPP's location in decimal degrees.</li>
				<li>describe the implementation phase of the project, using standard terms such as concept, planned, ongoing, etc.</li>
				<li>estimate how much water the project will hold or divert on an average annual basis, or how much water will be kept in the stream.</li>
				<li>estimate the total cost to implement the project, including capital and operations and maintenance.</li>
				<li>process the dataset with data-processing software to create a standardized dataset that is compatible with other basin IPP datasets.  This then allows 
				for statewide analysis and visualization.</li>
				<li>establish an improved workflow to facilitate maintenance and access to IPP datasets, which includes identifying how to publish IPP datasets on the web 
				to facilitate coordination and SWSI Update publication.  The workflow for IPP dataset processing might be similar to that in the figure shown at right.</li>
			  </ul>
			  <p> OWF used these recommendations to standardize the South Platte/Metro IPP dataset.  With few exceptions, OWF did not attempt to fill in missing 
			  data, such as yield or cost.  The primary exception was the determination of a general location for each IPP, which OWF estimated in order to create the maps 
              that follow.</p>

		following methods:  centroid of the county boundary, centroid of the municipal boundary, centroid of the water district 
		boundary, reservoir location, office address of water provider, or centroid of the county, municipal, or water district 
		boundary offset by 0.02 degrees longitude to allow for visibility on the map.</p>

			<a href="http://www.northernwater.org/sf" target="_blank">Northern Colorado Water Conservancy District</a> (Northern Water).  Its goal is to provide 
			the participating municipal water providers (shown on the map in red) with approximately 40,000 acre-feet of water each year.  The NISP project is 
			currently in the <a href="http://www.nwo.usace.army.mil/Missions/Regulatory-Program/Colorado/EIS-NISP/" target="_blank">EIS</a> process.</p>
			<p>NISP alternatives that are being considered include the construction of two reservoirs (shown as blue circles).  The first, Glade Reservoir, would be built northwest of the City of Fort Collins and 
			have a capacity of 170,000 acre-feet of water.  For comparison, Horsetooth Reservoir holds approximately 156,000 acre-feet.  The second 
			reservoir, Galeton Reservoir, would be built northeast of the City of Greeley and have a capacity of 45,600 acre-feet.</p>
			<p>Glade Reservoir would be filled with water from the Cache la Poudre River.  When its water right is in priority, water 
			will be diverted from the river at the existing Poudre Valley Canal near the mouth of the Poudre Canyon.  The maximum diversion rate 
			would be limited to approximately 1,000 cubic feet per second (cfs).</p>
			<p>Galeton Reservoir would be part of the South Platte Water Conservation Project.  Water from the South Platte River would be pumped to 
			Galeton Reservoir during winter and spring months.  Then, during irrigation season, the water would be released to the two largest 
			ditch companies in the Poudre watershed:  the New Cache La Poudre Irrigating Company and the Larimer and Weld Irrigation Company.  Through 
			a series of exchanges, the ditch companies will receive about 25% of their total supply from Galeton Reservoir while a similar amount of 
			water will be diverted upstream at the Poudre Valley Canal and stored in Glade Reservoir.</p>
			<p>Hover on a water provider on the map to see how much water it would be permitted under NISP.  Ditch company canals used to convey water from NISP are 
			shown in purple.</p>

            <h3>Example IPP:  ACWWA Flow Project</h3>
            <p>The Arapahoe County Water and Wastewater Authority (ACWWA) Flow Project is an example of a project to reduce the use of non-renewable groundwater supplies.  
			The ACWWA Flow Project will provide an annual average delivery of 4,400 acre-feet of renewable water to the ACWWA service area.</p>
			<p>The project began in 2009.  Components of the project include: </p>
			<ul>
			  <li>Renewable water rights from the South Platte River Basin</li>
			  <li>1,400 acre-feet of storage in Chambers Reservoir</li>
			  <li>Water treatment capacity in the East Cherry Creek Valley (ECCV) Water Treatment Plant</li>
			  <li>Water supply wells, storage and infrastructure to deliver water to the ECCV Water Treatment Plant</li>
			  <li>Carrying capacity in the ECCV Northern Pipeline, a 48-inch pipeline from the Barr Lake area to the ECCV service area</li>
			  <li>Interconnection to deliver water supplies from the ECCV service area to ACWWA's service area</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Currently, the ACWWA is supplying about one-third of its total supply from the Flow Project.  Aside from moving ACWWA's water supply away from non-renewable 
			groundwater to renewable sources, the water supply now has a lower hardness and lower total dissolved solids.</p>
