              <h2>IPP Background: SWSI 2004</h2>
              <p>The <a href="http://cwcbweblink.state.co.us/WebLink/ElectronicFile.aspx?docid=144066&searchid=2c16c041-d0b2-4ec5-ac42-8b95aa0c04e3&dbid=0" 
                target="_blank">Statewide Water Supply Initiative (SWSI)<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a>, first completed in 2004, was a comprehensive analysis of 
                existing water supplies and existing and projected water demands through the year 2030.  One of the major findings from SWSI 
                was that there will be a gap in water supply by 2030 for Colorado as a whole and for nearly all of the 8 major basins 
              (figure at right). </p>  
              <p>To address the gap, water management structural and non-structural options were identified for each basin. "Identified Projects 
                and Processes" (IPPs) were considered to be relatively well-defined options that could reasonably be expected to be implemented by 
                2030 to address current or increasing water needs.  A second category of options was titled "Options for Alternatives".  These were 
                options for meeting the remaining gap and were considered to have implementation issues, were more conceptual in nature or were 
                more likely to be implemented in later years.  Many of the options identified that would benefit agricultural, environmental or 
                recreational users were categorized as Options for Alternatives because their implementation was less certain due to reasons such 
                as a lack of suitable funding.  As such, the initial IPP list for each basin tended to focus on municipal and industrial (M&I) uses.</p>
              <p>It was determined that IPPs had the ability to meet about 80% of Colorado's municipal and industrial water needs through 2030. 
                However, if the IPPs are not successfully implemented, Colorado would see a greater reduction in irrigated agricultural lands as 
                municipal and industrial water providers seek permanent transfers of agricultural water rights.</p>
              <p>General categories of SWSI 2004 M&I IPPs included:</p>  
              <ul>
                <li>conservation</li> 
                <li>growing into existing supply (new infrastructure needed to use existing supplies)</li> 
                <li>increased reuse of existing or future consumable supplies</li> 
                <li>rehabilitation, reoperation or enlargement of existing water supply facilities</li>
                <li>water transfers</li>
                <li>new water supply projects (later called new transbasin diversions)</li>
                <li>augmentation plans</li>

              <p>More-detailed IPP information was gathered during SWSI 2010 than was developed for SWSI 2004.  The following categories were used

              <ul>
               <li>agricultural water transfers</li>
               <li>reuse of existing fully consumable supplies</li>

              <p>If successfully implemented, these IPPs were to meet some, but not all, of Colorado's 2050 M&I water needs (figure at right).  
                Therefore, these projects were considered critical to meeting Colorado's future water supply needs.</p>

              <h2>IPP Background: SWSI 2010 Environmental & Recreational IPPs</h2>
               <p>A different approach was taken for environmental and recreational (E&R, also called nonconsumptive) IPPs.  Each basin roundtable 
                 described focus areas that represented where Colorado's important E&R attributes are located, such as species.  The focus area maps 
                 (statewide version at right) were intended to assist in identifying where E&R needs are being met, where additional future study 
                 may need to take place or where implementation projects are needed. Arkansas and Rio Grande basins chose to associate IPPs with 
                 Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) basins and other roundtables chose to associate IPPs with stream segments.The Colorado Water Conservation 
                 Board (CWCB) was then able to preliminarily identify focus areas with and without IPPs.</p>
               <p>The key finding of SWSI 2010 was that Colorado faces a shortage of water for meeting <b><i>both</i></b> consumptive and E&R needs. 
                 The key recommendation was that basin roundtables should determine and pursue projects and methods that address multiple purposes, 
                 including municipal, industrial, agricultural, environmental, recreational, risk management and compact compliance needs.  This 
                 recommendation led to the creation of Basin Implementation Plans (BIPs) for each basin.</p>

                was completed in 2015 and continued to use the same general categories as SWSI 2010 to describe municipal and industrial IPPs, such 
                as agricultural water transfers, growth into existing supplies and firming in-basin water rights.  Much of the IPP data was not 
                greatly updated from the SWSI 2010 list.</p>
              <p class="lead">The list of IPPs ranges from general projects, such as "Morgan County Unspecified

              <h2>South Platte & Metro BIP and Agricultural IPPs</h2>
              <p>As indicated in the figure to the right, irrigated acreage in the South Platte Basin is projected to decline by 2050 due to 
                reallocation of agricultural water supplies to municipal and industrial uses.  However, IPPs specific to agricultural needs were not 
                developed in the 2015 BIP. It is generally understood that reductions in yield from M&I IPPs will likely lead to much greater 
                increases in agricultural transfers as a means to meet M&I demands.  Therefore, to meet agricultural needs, M&I IPP implementation 
                must be successful.  While specific projects were not detailed for agricultural needs, multipurpose projects that also benefit 
                agriculture will most likely involve new Colorado River supplies 
                (<a href="https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/SouthPlatteBasinImplementationPlan-04172015.pdf" target="_blank">
                BIP<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a>, p.4-36).  Additional surface storage projects that benefit agriculture, such as the <a href="https://chatfieldreallocation.org/"

              E&R IPPs that are based on SWSI 2010. General categories of projects include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>mine remediation</li> 
              <li>land conservation</li> 
              <li>river restoration</li> 
              <li>fish passage structures</li>
              <li>riparian restoration</li>
              <li>bank stabilization</li>

            <p>The SWSI 2010 E&R IPP list is not publicly available in machine-readable format.  Therefore, the E&R IPPs map layer is not shown here. 
              However, instream flow rights can be considered a form of IPP because they fulfill an environmental need.  Instream flow rights are rights 
              for minimum flows exclusively granted to the Colorado Water Conservation Board (CWCB) to preserve or improve the natural environment to a 
              reasonable degree. This map shows decreed instream flow rights in the South Platte and Metro basins.</p>

              <h2>IPPs Updated for SWSI Update and South Platte Data Platform</h2>
              <p>The <a href="http://cwcb.state.co.us/water-management/water-supply-planning/Pages/SWSIUpdate.aspx" target="_blank">SWSI Update<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a> project 
                is currently updating the SWSI 2010 study using new data and methodologies, with expected completion in 2019.  The Open Water Foundation also 
                received a CWCB grant for the South Platte Data Platform, which is implementing data analyses and visualizations to help the South Platte 
                and Metro Roundtables better use data resources and tell stories relevant to the South Platte Basin.  As part of these projects, IPP data from 
                SWSI 2010 were reviewed and recommendations were made regarding the standardization of data formats and the addition of new content.  Some of 
                the recommendations included the following:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>datasets should exist in a flat, Excel file format.  Excel is a common tool and the datasets can be maintained with minimal skill and can 
                  be used by multiple software tools</li>
                <li>a unique identifier should be given for each IPP, in the format of Basin-Year-Number, such as SP-2015-0001.  This allows for cross-referencing 
                  between datasets</li>
                <li>indicate the water body that is the primary source of water for the project, using the <a href="https://geonames.usgs.gov/apex/f?p=138:1:0:::::" 
                target="_blank">Geographic Names Information System<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a> ID and name.  This allows for cross-referencing between datasets, such as the 
                <a href="http://cdss.state.co.us/GIS/Pages/AllGISData.aspx" target="_blank">Source Water Route Framework<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a></li>
                <li>provide the IPP's location in decimal degrees</li>
                <li>process the dataset with data-processing software to create a standardized dataset that is compatible with other basin IPP datasets. 
                  This then allows for statewide analysis and visualization</li>
                <li>establish an improved workflow to facilitate maintenance and access to IPP datasets, which includes identifying how to publish IPP datasets 
                  on the web to facilitate coordination and SWSI Update publication.  The workflow for IPP dataset processing might be similar to that in the 
                  figure shown at right</li>
              </ul>
              <p> OWF used these recommendations to standardize the South Platte/Metro IPP dataset.  With few exceptions, OWF did not attempt to fill in missing 
                 data, such as yield or cost.  The primary exception was the determination of a general location for each IPP, which OWF estimated in order to 
                 create the maps that follow.</p>

            <h3>IPPs by Location Flag</h3>
            <p>The existing South Platte/Metro IPP dataset did not have location data for IPP projects.  Thus, it was necessary to estimate general locations. 
              This map displays municipal and industrial (M&I) IPPs for both the South Platte and Metro basins.  IPPs are color-coded by the technique used to 
              estimate general locations. Locations of IPPs were estimated using one of the following methods:  <span style="color:red;">centroid of the county 
              boundary</span>, <span style="color:orange;">centroid of the municipal boundary</span>, <span style="color:yellow;">centroid of the water district 
              boundary</span>, <span style="color:green;">reservoir location</span>, <span style="color:blue;">office address of water provider</span>, or 
              <span style="color:purple;">centroid of the county</span>, <span style="color:brown;">municipal</span>, or water district boundary offset by 0.02 
              degrees longitude to allow for visibility on the map.</p>

              <li>many general locations have been estimated because locations were not included in original IPP data</li>
              <li>IPPs may include multiple water sources, infrastructure components, and destinations.  A general location point is used to provide basic location

            <h3>Example IPP:  NISP</h3>
            <p>The <a href="http://www.northernwater.org/sf/WaterProjects/NISP" target="_blank">Northern Integrated Supply Project<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a>, or NISP, 
               is an example of a multi-purpose storage project.  NISP is coordinated by the <a href="http://www.northernwater.org/sf" target="_blank">
               Northern Colorado Water Conservancy District<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a> (Northern Water district boundary shown in black).  NISP's goal is to provide 
               the <span style="color:red;">participating municipal water providers</span> with approximately 40,000 acre-feet of water each year. 
               The NISP project is currently in the <a href="http://www.nwo.usace.army.mil/Missions/Regulatory-Program/Colorado/EIS-NISP/" 
               target="_blank">EIS<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a> process.</p>
            <p>NISP alternatives that are being considered include the construction of two <span style="color:blue;">reservoirs</span>.  
               The first, Glade Reservoir, would be built northwest of the City of Fort Collins and have a capacity of 170,000 acre-feet of water.  
               For comparison, Horsetooth Reservoir holds approximately 156,000 acre-feet.  The second reservoir, Galeton Reservoir, would be 
               built northeast of the City of Greeley and have a capacity of 45,600 acre-feet.</p>
            <p>Glade Reservoir would be filled with water from the Cache la Poudre River.  When its water right is in priority, water 
               will be diverted from the river at the existing Poudre Valley Canal near the mouth of the Poudre Canyon.  The maximum diversion rate 
               would be limited to approximately 1,000 cubic feet per second (cfs).</p>
            <p>Galeton Reservoir would be part of the South Platte Water Conservation Project.  Water from the South Platte River would be pumped to 
               Galeton Reservoir during winter and spring months.  Then, during irrigation season, the water would be released to the two largest 
               ditch companies in the Poudre watershed:  the New Cache La Poudre Irrigating Company and the Larimer and Weld Irrigation Company. 
               Through a series of exchanges, the ditch companies will receive about 25% of their total supply from Galeton Reservoir while a similar 
               amount of water will be diverted upstream at the Poudre Valley Canal and stored in Glade Reservoir.</p>
            <p>Hover on a water provider on the map to see how much water it would be permitted under NISP.  <span style="color:purple;">Ditch company

               is an example of a project to reduce the use of non-renewable groundwater supplies.  The ACWWA Flow Project will provide an annual average 
               delivery of 4,400 acre-feet of renewable water to the ACWWA service area.</p>
            <p>The project began in 2009.  Components of the project include: </p>
            <ul>
               <li>renewable water rights from the South Platte River Basin</li>
               <li>1,400 acre-feet of storage in <span style="color:blue;">Chambers Reservoir</span></li>
               <li>water treatment capacity in the <span style="color:green;">East Cherry Creek Valley (ECCV) Water Treatment Plant</span></li>
               <li>water supply wells, storage and infrastructure to deliver water to the ECCV Water Treatment Plant</li>
               <li>carrying capacity in the ECCV Northern Pipeline, a 48-inch pipeline (dashed line) from the Barr Lake area to the <span style="color:blue;">ECCV service area</span></li>
               <li>interconnection to deliver water supplies from the ECCV service area to <span style="color:red;">ACWWA's service area</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Currently, the ACWWA is supplying about one-third of its total supply from the Flow Project.  Aside from moving ACWWA's water supply away 
              from non-renewable groundwater to renewable sources, the water supply now has a lower hardness and lower total dissolved solids.</p>

			  <p style="text-align:left;">This story is designed to provide information in one-page sections, each of which should fit within the web browser page.  To move forward 
			  or backward in the story, use the following options:</p>
			  <ul>
			    <li style="text-align:left;">Page Up and Page Down keys</li>
			    <li style="text-align:left;">Arrow Up and Arrow Down keys</li>				
				<li style="text-align:left;">Mouse scroll wheel - a slight turn will advance the page automatically</li>
				<li style="text-align:left;">Menu at the top of the story to navigate to major sections</li>
				<li style="text-align:left;">Click on the dots on the right side of the screen - hover over a dot to see the title of the page</li>
			  </ul>	
			  <p style="text-align:left;">Additional instructions for viewing the story include:</p>
			  <ul>
			    <li style="text-align:left;">The content is best viewed on a relatively large display and has not been optimized for mobile devices.</li>
				<li style="text-align:left;">If content does not seem to fit in the browser window, maximize the window size or use Ctrl - to reduce font sizes. 
				Ctrl + can be used to increase font sizes.</li>
				<li style="text-align:left;">For interactive maps, the default behavior for the mouse scroll is to advance the story page.  Click on the mouse 
				icon (<img src="images/mouse_white.png" width="16px"/>) in the map to change mouse scrolling to zoom behavior.  Once changed, 
				the behavior will apply only to the specific map.</li>
				<li style="text-align:left;">Interactive maps can be repositioned by holding the left mouse button and dragging the map.</li>
				<li style="text-align:left;">Scrollable text areas are provided in some pages and can be scrolled by dragging the text area scroll bar.</li>
				<li style="text-align:left;">External pages are indicated with a <img src="images/baseline_launch_white_18dp.png" width="12px"/> graphic and 
				will be shown in a separate tab when selected.</li>
				<li style="text-align:left;">Links to sections within the story and external pages are generally the same font color as normal text but are 
				indicated with underlines.</li>
				<li style="text-align:left;">Visualizations that will slow down the story are linked to as separate pages and will be shown in a different tab 
				when selected.  Mouse over the image to see a popup link to the separate page.</li>
				<li style="text-align:left;">Interactive maps provide popups to view data.  If the popup flashes, drag the map to reposition it so that 
				the popup does not occur in the same area as the map instruction box.</li>			  
				<li style="text-align:left;">Some maps allow clicking on map markers to access links to additional data.</li>
			  </ul>
			  <p style="text-align:left;">Interactive graphs typically behave as follows:</p>
			  <ul>
			    <li style="text-align:left;">Zoom into the graph either by holding the left mouse button and drawing a rectangle on the graph or by clicking/holding/dragging the buttons 
				on either end of the time slider in the overview graph below the main graph.</li>  
				<li style="text-align:left;">Once the time slider "window" (light blue shaded area in the overview graph) has been narrowed, use the mouse to drag the shaded area to another 
				time period.  Or, click in the overview graph on either side of the shaded area to center the graph period on the clicked point.</li>
				<li style="text-align:left;">To fully zoom out, drag the ends of the shaded area in the overview graph to the margins of the graph.</li>    
				<li style="text-align:left;">All time series can be selected or deselected by clicking on the "Select All Series" or "Deselect All Series" buttons below the graph.  It is 
				also possible to individually select or deselect one time series at a time by clicking on the time series name in the legend.</li>
